## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Just add the buildpack to your heroku app by executing:

```bash
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/RohanDebroy/heroku-buildpack-wkhtmltopdf.git
```

You can also force this buildpack to be the first Heroku process by using the
`--index` option:

```bash
heroku buildpacks:add --index=1 https://github.com/RohanDebroy/heroku-buildpack-wkhtmltopdf.git
```
### Aptfile(Optional) <a name="aptfile"></a>
The <b>Aptfile</b> can be included in the parent directory of you app. If you add the latest or custom wkhtmltopdf binary download url to the aptfile as described below then the buildpack can bypass heroku stack detection and download the version for you.

    #filename should be "Aptfile" without quotes.
    # you can include links to specific .deb files or .tar.xz
    https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.focal_amd64.deb
    

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The binaries `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage` will be available on `/app/bin`,
you can just execute `/app/bin/wkhtmltopdf ` and `/app/bin/wkhtmltoimage`  from your app.
